# K-1LevelMathGame

A game called "Newt's Adventure" where kids can practice their skills in counting, addition, subtraction, and equality.

The game can be used on both Windows and Mac OSX. These builds can be found in the ProjectBuilds folder. It is designed to be a standalone game on your machine where you can save your progress and continue your game later.

The main area lets the player run around using the arrow keys, and they can follow the paths to get to the different mini games that let them practice their math skills. There is also a "Timed Challenge" section that lets the player try to answer as many addition or subtraction problems as they can in one minute. There are 3 different difficulty levels to choose from for the timed challenge.

In the mini games, there are 3 levels. When the player answers 10 questions right they move to the next level for that mini game. Each level gets more difficult than the last until the player beat all the levels, then the difficulty remains the same no matter how many questions they answer. Each time a level is beat in any mini game, new objects appear in the main area. 

When the player beats all the levels of all the mini games, they have the option of resetting their progress in the mini games (does not affect timed challenge high scores). If they reset their progress, a gold star appears in the left hand corner of the screen and all progress is wiped. Each time the game is reset, a gold star is added up to 10 gold stars.
